But not to do things that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of other people tout on YouTube. Like, wow, you can spawn cubes and create levels. I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought that was a little\u0026hellip; lame, I think.\nSo instead, what\u0026rsquo;s been more interesting to me is the idea of integrating the models into what you do on a daily basis and enhancing things that you perhaps already do as opposed to trying to get them to do complete level creation, or complete blueprint creation, which are very complicated and require a very long set of steps.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think you can really get an LLM to do something like that successfully right now. At least not to a level which is really convincingly good.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I actually want to build: I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about basically giving it access to things that you do on a daily basis like creating blueprints, refactoring nodes, extracting the parts that are interesting out of functions. Just writing tool tips, writing documentation, speeding up workflows that we all do.\nMy first and most prioritized usage right now is the blueprint refactoring usage. So prioritizing that usage for me is very important.\nMy blueprint refactoring toolkit I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of taking some of the code I have in the BlueprintTraverser class, and moving it to a tool inside of custom implementation of the MCP thing.\nFunctions:\nGetAllGraphNames - Returns the names of all the graphs in the Blueprint GetAllEventNamesInGraph(String: graph_name) - Returns the names of all the events in the specific graph in the asset GetAllFunctionNames - Returns an array of strings with the function names GetFunctionInfo(String: function_name) - Returns information about a specific function in JSON format with name, tooltip, category, whether it\u0026rsquo;s pure, thread safe, const, plus all the inputs and outputs with their types Variables:\nGetAllVariableNames - If I get one of these then it can use the names to access more information about this variable GetVariableInfo(String: variable_name) - This one is really useful to get all the information about one specific variable SetVariableInfo(VariableInfo: variable_info) - For making changes I could also add things like:\nGetFunctionExplanation(String: function_name) - Explains what a function does in a simple manner CreateFunction(FunctionInfo: function_info) I\u0026rsquo;m stuck on this problem\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure if it\u0026rsquo;s useful to give all the nodes and the connections like I had them in the blueprint documentation generator. But I could because I already have all the code for that. Though if I do it that way, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I have the benefit of saving it to memory.\nAnd regardless of anything else, none of these ways of talking about things will actually let it help me arrange them or do things in the editor. All of these are about it reading and most it can maybe write tooltips, or categorize functions, but actually changing nodes seems really far-fetched.\nThe Memory Challenge I need a form of memory for this AI where it\u0026rsquo;ll remember the connections really well, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to retrace them somehow.\nI want to have some sort of toolset for Claude to be able to help me refactor blueprints. Refactoring in this case understood as: the process of shifting nodes from one function to another after having thoroughly analyzed the systems in the project to see what can be improved, creating new functions to extract sets of nodes into\u0026hellip; etc.\nOne example of such refactoring might be understanding a graph (through JSON), and being capable of using tools to extract nodes, move nodes\u0026hellip; etc. to ensure that the functionality remains but we achieve a better result at a system level.\nSome interesting stuff I ran into while building this I found someone on YouTube who had already created a base MCP, but it was for UE 5.6, and I\u0026rsquo;m working in UE 5.0, so I had to port that first. Additionally, the base structure was way too over-architected and had too many components, so I had to reduce a ton and simplify.\nIn the process, a lot of things broke. I think a lot of that was quite interesting, actually, and I wish I had filmed it.\nOne thing I think is interesting to mention is that in Claude Desktop, there are now two types of \u0026ldquo;MCPs.\u0026rdquo; There\u0026rsquo;s stdio MCPs which would just be using a normal Python script, and then there are DTX files, which are basically packaged connectors.
