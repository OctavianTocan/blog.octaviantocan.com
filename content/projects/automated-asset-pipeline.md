Managing assets across multiple platforms (Unity, Unreal, various marketplaces) was becoming a nightmare. 
Every update meant manually exporting for Unity URP, HDRP, Built-in, Unreal Engine versions, packaging for 
Gumroad, uploading everywhere, updating docs... Built a system that handles the entire pipeline with one command. 
Sure, it took three weeks to build what would've taken a few hours to do manually, but now those few hours 
happen automatically forever. Read about <a href="#">how the pipeline works</a>.
