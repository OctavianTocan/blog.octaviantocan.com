Sometimes developers just need good weapon models without the full template. This pack provides animated, 
low-poly guns that work across Unity and Unreal Engine. Each weapon is fully rigged with swappable parts—barrels, 
magazines, scopes, and more. The reload animations took longer to perfect than modeling all the weapons combined. 
Getting the magazine physics to feel natural while remaining performance-friendly was educational. 
Available on <a href="#">Unity Asset Store</a> and <a href="#">Unreal Marketplace</a>.
