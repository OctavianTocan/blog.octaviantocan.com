Started as a simple FPS counter overlay for debugging frame drops in projects. Ended up as a comprehensive 
performance monitoring suite after discovering that measuring performance... impacts performance. Go figure. 
Went through multiple iterations before finally cracking non-intrusive monitoring with async profiling. 
Currently optimizing the UI rendering pipeline because apparently I never learn.
